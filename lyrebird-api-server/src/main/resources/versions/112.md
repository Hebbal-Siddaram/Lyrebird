**Lyrebird 1.1.2** | _28/07/2018_

### Notes about this version
- Selfupdate is still broken on your version but will be fixed with this one. 
You need to update manually via "open in browser" button in the meanwhile.
- Changes in the way we store sessions means **we need to wipe your currently saved settings**. 
You **will** have to re-add your twitter account on startup.
Sorry for that, we will try to avoid that in the future.

### Features
- Direct messages now work as expected! (they do not auto-refresh due to Twitter limitations unfortunately) #70

### Bugs
- The reduction to tray icon included some annoying issues on macOS, they are now mostly fixed. #80
- Unretweeting a status was essentially not working correctly in 50% of cases. Now it works all the time #84
- Fix selfupdate failing due to the application being running during the update process. Now Lyrebird closes first. #78
- Replying to a tweet generated a normal mention rather than an actual reply. Now replies are proper replies. #87

### Internal
- Move from Twitter4A to Twitter4J until development on Twitter4J restarts. #82
- The application should be more reactive, once again

### Known issues
- Startup times still slow
- Release notes still ugly #92
- No selfupdate on Linux systems (send help if you know how to go about it) #58

Thank you for being a user of Lyrebird!
