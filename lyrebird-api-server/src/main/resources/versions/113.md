**Lyrebird 1.1.3** | _15/08/2018_

### Notes about this version
- The changelog is ugly for the very last time! Get a good look at this horror because next times it will be 
absolutely gorgeous :)
- Twitter has deprecated Streaming (as of the 16th of August 2018) so all streaming is lost. We now auto-refresh in the
background as often as allowed by rate limitation of the Twitter API but obviously this is very inferior.

### Features
- Huge improvements to performance of going from one view to another (Timeline, Mentions...) once opened during
application lifetime #94
- URLs in tweets' content are now correctly placed, highlighted and clickable in Tweets #98
- Mentions in tweets' content are now highlighted, clickable and open user details when clicked #105
- Hashtags in tweets' content are now highlighted, clickable and open hashtag web search when clicked #106

### Bugs
- System tray icon should be better than a black square on Linux now :) If you are using Gnome, install appropriate 
`libappindicator` lib for your system (64 bits version at least, 32 won't hurt if installed as well) or use 
TopIcons+ Gnome extension #99
- A rare asynchronous deadlock could happen on some systems with very disparate CPU/GPU performance preventing the load
of the Timeline view on startup. Now it's always there #100

### Internal
- Lyrebird is now mostly JPMS compliant. Server and API modules are, main app is also ready but simply lacks support
for multi-module JPMS-enabled project in zenjavafx native packaging maven plugin #67
- Streaming has been completely abandonned following Twitter's decision to shut it down with no reasonable alternative
at this moment #104
- Streaming has been replaced with background refresh heuristics to palliate the lost functionnality #111

### Known issues
- Selfupdate on linux has been partially worked out by offering repositories but that still need integration 
into the app, in what way remains unknown #96
- Loading more tweets in a timeline-style view still sticks scrollbar to the end and thus "JUMPS" to the bottom for no
valid reason whatsoever #95

Thank you for being a user of Lyrebird!
