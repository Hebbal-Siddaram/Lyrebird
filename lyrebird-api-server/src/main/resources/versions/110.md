**Lyrebird 1.1.0** | _18/07/2018_

### Features
- Display user profiles and follow/unfollow users
- Replying to tweets
- Self-updates for macOS and Windows (will set-up repositories for Linux users soonish)
- Improve layout/design a lot on many ways. Better to look for yourself than read this.
- Notifications when you have been followed/unfollowed/mentioned, 
or a tweet of yours has been liked, retweeted, quoted...

### Bugs
- Mostly internal non user-affecting bugs

### Known issues
- DMs still kind of broken. Will be fixed by next release.
- Release notes still look like trash but will be improved upon too

Thank you very much for trying out Lyrebird by the way :)
